# Learning Git Bash - For students
For all students who are willing to learn the same way I am doing, I would suggest start with understanding what is Git and How to use Git Bash. I used [this] (http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) for understanding how to use Git and GitHub and [CheatSheet Page] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) for text editing on GitHub.
