# Project Classification 
Inorder to keep the account clean and understandable, I planned to classify all the projects into four categories. I decided these categories based on my plans for why I am going to use this account. I planned to upload all the scripts I will create while learning in a class to my GitHub repositories. The classes may have their corresponding assignements and projects. I might also develop independent projects for practicing different topics or as a product for a Company or Indivdual. So, Likewise I have 4 prefixes for every Repository I make. 

# 1. L - For Students
These are all the repositories that I make when I start learning something new or I start a new course. Such repositories will not have a complete project but scripts that will demonstrate any particular feature in subject I am learning. Example: A script showing how to add comments in C++. This repository may contain files that will store the links to the assignments(assignments.md) and projects(projects.md) of the course. The repository will be enough for anyone to know where I learnt a particular course from. Also, I will give the links in the description of the respective repository. 

# 2. A
Any repository with prefix 'A' contains assignments from any particular course. The name of the course can be found in the description of the repository. 

# 3. P
'P' prefix will be used for projects that will be blend of technologies I learnt in a particular assigments. The projects will also have course name in the description for which the project was made. 

# 4. IP
'IP' stands for Independent Projects that were not a part of any course and were developed for any company or individual. These repositories may contain projects that were developed for practicing and getting indept understanding of a subject.
